## Description

This application creates ReadMe files with a license

## Usage

This particular project was the 9th homework assignment in my Georgia Tech coding bootcamp, created to generate Readmes, and to exercise understanding of the following:

- utilizing node and modules
- using gitignore to hide the node modules from github
- creating files and utilizing writeFile() in js
- Learning about the various types of licenses that can be used for projects, and how to display them on a readme file

## Installation

Can be installed using Node with an intergrated terminal to the corresponding js file
